The process of changing styling the html with CSS started with attaching a screenshot of the goal image into chatgpt, along with the beginning html to give me a baseline website to work with. After that, I manually changed very small things, for example, I started with the header, creating margins around the box, softening the edges, and changing the look of the font in that header. After that I went down the line of things that chatgpt missed, occasionally asking it general questions. I had chatgpt add another <div> section in the html to capture all of the main content to put it ina  box like the header. The biggest struggles I faced were working with the new version of chat that edit over previous versions, becuse no matter how hard I tried to prompt it, it would not save my manual changes and would edit its own older version.
In the end I googled a lot of formatting and used the class slides to manually change most of the rest of the css, ocassionally going to chat to try to help and usually ignoring its ineffective result. The hardest parts of the page for me were shortening the line under Introduction and Common Octopus, as well as organizing all of the elements within the octopus quiz ssection. I just eyeballed all the colors as close as I could and I am happy with the result.
